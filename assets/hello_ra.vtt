- Hey everyone. Welcome to fourth douglas.
- And fourth hamilton at Bursley.

00:08.001 --> 00:11.000
- Don't worry, I'm not going to make any bad covid jokes

00:011.010 --> 00:14.000
- At least until we meet in our welcome meetings, uh.
- So get ready for those.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
- My name is Kartik,  uh, and I am your RA here
- at 4217 Douglas.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
- So for you Hamilton kids it's down the hall 
- I guess across the hall for you guys

00:27.010 --> 00:32.000
- Don't worry, we'll be sharing a lot of tips and resources 
- and contact info and also some boring stuff when

00:32.010 --> 00:35.000
- we have our welcome meetings 

00:36.010 --> 00:41.000
- I hope you guys have a smooth move in
- Over the next coming week.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.000
- I will most likely be running into you guys
- very soon

00:44.010 --> 00:49.000
-  as you guys move in.
- and of course we'll be meeting very soon after

00:49.010 --> 00:54.000
- at the welcome meetings on Zoom as well.
- I wish it were in person but

00:54.000 -->  00:59.000

- And we're going to have to make the best of it.
